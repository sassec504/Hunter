1.Build “Analyst-Guided Open Hunting” Workflows
Goal: Help analysts hunt without writing a single query — not even choosing Sigma rules manually.
Let the user choose a tactic or technique (from a UI drop-down or MITRE Navigator–style grid).

Automatically fetch all relevant Sigma rules.

Generate both:

Strict detection queries (tight, exact matches)

Loose open-hunt queries (fuzzier logic — partial matches, heuristics)

Run both types and show side-by-side results.

2.Introduce Feedback-Driven Query Refinement
Let users filter out fields or values (e.g., exclude process names, IPs).

Auto-rebuild the query with filters applied.

Rerun hunt instantly — call this “one-click pivot hunting.”

3.Auto-Correlation + Attack Timeline Builder
Pain Point: Analysts struggle to see how individual anomalies connect.

Feature:

Group hunt results into MITRE tactics or Cyber Kill Chain phases.

Automatically stitch together correlated events by user, IP, host, session, or process chain.

Render as an attack timeline or investigation mindmap.Auto-Correlation + Attack Timeline Builder

Build Visual Mindmaps with Pivots
Here’s how to make mindmaps meaningful for threat hunting:

Center node: Suspicious entity (host, user, process)

Branches: Events, commands, network connections, logons

Icons/colors: Represent tactic (Execution, Persistence, etc.)

Clicking a node could pivot to:

Related events

Similar behavior from other users/systems

Next hunt step (linked technique)

Mindmaps should show:

Sequence

Suspicion level

MITRE context

Add Suspicion Scoring & Enrichment
Assign scores to each result (e.g., access to LSASS = 80/100)
Enrich with:

Threat intel (VirusTotal, Shodan, etc.)

Process reputation (signed? known tool?)

Let user sort/filter by threat score
Explore Behavioral Detection
Introduce ML/anomaly logic later:

Profile normal behavior (e.g., PowerShell only from certain users)

Alert when something deviates

Use Isolation Forest, Z-score, etc.

Re-run Hunts as Scheduled Campaigns
Let users convert ad-hoc hunts into scheduled jobs

Show trending data (e.g., spike in suspicious PowerShell this week)

6.Group Results into Logical Entities
Instead of mapping every log line, cluster results around:

Users

Hosts

Processes

Tactics or Kill Chain Phase

This compresses hundreds of logs into a few meaningful nodes.

8.Use Suspicion Scoring to Limit Visual Noise
Assign scores to events (e.g., based on MITRE tag, anomaly detection, or enrichment), and only include the top N results in the mindmap.

Add a toggle:

“Show top 10 most suspicious chains”
“Expand full activity for this user/process”

Time-Based Collapsing
If a user ran 200 PowerShell commands in a minute, you don’t need 200 nodes.
Instead:

Collapse into one node: “PowerShell activity spike (200 commands)”

Expand on click only if needed

11.Visual Decay or Layering
Use layered nodes or radial layouts, with:

Center = Entity (user/host)

Inner layer = Top technique results

Outer layers = Optional expanded details

Users explore the graph like peeling an onion.
