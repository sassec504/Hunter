Build a threat hunting visualization system using React (frontend) and Python/FastAPI (backend). Include the following mind map features:

1. **MITRE/Cyber Kill Chain Categorization Mind Map**
- Use vis-network or React Flow.
- Root nodes = MITRE tactics (e.g., Execution, Lateral Movement).
- Children = techniques (e.g., T1059).
- Fetch and display hunting results on node click.
- Highlight techniques with more results using red or larger size.

2. **Pivot Point Graph Mind Map**
- Use Cytoscape.js to visualize artifacts (usernames, processes, IPs, domains).
- Each node is a unique artifact from logs.
- Edges represent co-occurrence in the same event.
- If a field (e.g., user "admin") appears in multiple events, make the node brighter or larger.
- Add right-click option: "Pivot and Hunt" → launches a new automated query.

3. **Timeline-Based Attack Map**
- Use vis-timeline or a Gantt library.
- Each row = entity (e.g., host or user).
- Blocks = suspicious actions (logon, process, network).
- Connect related events across rows to show movement or correlated actions.
- Events are color-coded by MITRE technique or risk level.

4. **Suspicious User Behavior Mind Map**
- Each node = user.
- Child nodes = behaviors (e.g., unusual login time, PowerShell run, lateral move).
- Highlight users with high anomaly scores.
- Use a filter panel to show only abnormal users.

5. **Beaconing Detection Mind Map**
- Build a radial map.
- Center node = internal host.
- Outer nodes = external IPs it connects to.
- Edges show connections. Color edge or node red if:
  - Frequency is high
  - Periodic pattern detected
- Tooltip should show connection frequency, duration, and ports.

6. **Technique Cluster (TTP Co-occurrence) Map**
- Each node = MITRE technique.
- Draw edges between techniques that co-occur in the same event chain or session.
- Group and highlight common attack clusters (e.g., Initial Access → Execution → Lateral Movement).

7. **Detection Confidence Mind Map**
- Each node = event (e.g., suspicious command).
- Edges = shared fields (e.g., same user/IP/process).
- Assign suspicion score (0–1).
- Visualize nodes with size/color based on score.
- Add filter to view only score > X threshold.

Global Features:
- All mind maps should allow "hunt again" or "expand search" actions from nodes.
- Include backend endpoints to fetch logs, Sigma rules, and mapped MITRE techniques.
- Data should be fed from pre-parsed JSON logs with timestamps, artifacts, and matched rules.
- Add ability to export any graph to PNG/PDF.
