Great question — this is a **real** challenge in automated threat hunting: when the system returns **too many results**, how do you avoid turning the mindmap into a spaghetti mess?

Here’s how you can solve this with smart design and filtering:

---

### **1. Group Results into Logical Entities**

Instead of mapping every log line, **cluster results** around:

* **Users**
* **Hosts**
* **Processes**
* **Tactics or Kill Chain Phase**

**Mindmap example:**

```
                [User: admin]
                      |
        +-------------+--------------+
        |                            |
  [Process: powershell.exe]   [Process: psexec.exe]
        |                            |
 [Accessed: lsass.exe]         [Connected: host B]
```

This **compresses hundreds of logs** into a few meaningful nodes.

---

### **2. Use Suspicion Scoring to Limit Visual Noise**

Assign scores to events (e.g., based on MITRE tag, anomaly detection, or enrichment), and **only include the top N results** in the mindmap.

Add a toggle:

> “Show top 10 most suspicious chains”
> “Expand full activity for this user/process”

---

### **3. Time-Based Collapsing**

If a user ran 200 PowerShell commands in a minute, you don’t need 200 nodes.

Instead:

* Collapse into one node: **“PowerShell activity spike (200 commands)”**
* Expand on click only if needed

---

### **4. Pivot Paths Only, Not Everything**

Only show paths that:

* Link 2+ tactics (e.g., Execution → Lateral Movement)
* Lead to an enriched IOC (e.g., connection to known malicious IP)
* Come from a suspicious parent process

This keeps the map focused on **suspicious chains**, not every log.

---

### **5. Visual Decay or Layering**

Use **layered nodes or radial layouts**, with:

* Center = Entity (user/host)
* Inner layer = Top technique results
* Outer layers = Optional expanded details

Users explore the graph like peeling an onion.

### Summary: Smart Mindmap for Large Hunts

| Problem               | Solution                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Too many results      | Group by entity (user/host/process)           |
| Visual clutter        | Score and cap top N most suspicious           |
| Repetitive logs       | Collapse repeated patterns (e.g., 100 logons) |
| Not all events useful | Show only linked/pivotable ones               |
| Hard to explore       | Click to expand chain stages or tactics       |

Would you like me to generate a **visual mockup** of one of these mindmap layouts to show how it would work with real hunting data?
